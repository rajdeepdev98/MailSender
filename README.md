# MailSender
A Simple Mail Sender Bot

The program addressparser.py is used to parse through all the email addresses in contactlist.txt
The program textparser.py is used to parse through the text in message.txt

The main program mailsender.py sends the text in message.txt to each person listed in contactlist.txt with a personalised greeting

This is just the basic version and more functions will be added in the further updates
